# Artificial-Plants
## Leo Guagenti - 5/22/19
This an experimental design for a plant structure evolution simulator I am working on.<br>
The demo for the Artifical Plants project is: https://leoguagenti.github.io/Artificial-Plants/
<br></br>
There is still a lot I would like to change, fix and add to this project. Currently I am unhappy with some bugs<br>
that prevent trees from generating or cause them to generate incorrectly. In addition I'd like to add functions<br> 
that allow for the shifting of a parent branch, where the shift affects the children branches.<br>
